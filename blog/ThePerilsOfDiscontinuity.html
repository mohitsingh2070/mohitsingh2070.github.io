        <h2>Inculturation and indigestion</h2>
        <p></p>Inculturation and indigestion is not an unknown achilles heel for hindus. 
            Inculturation stands for ones attempt to synthesise the culture and belief of another religion (Hinduism) not with a view to assimilate with it but to subvert it from within, with the eventual aim of conversion.<sup>1</sup>
            If the powerful aarti at Vishwanath temple is in danger of dying out, it is not so much because the temple is controlled by “secular bureaucrats”, “corrupt bureaucrats”, “indifferent bureaucrats” or even simply bureaucrats would suffice.<sup>2</sup>
            How come the oldest surviving civilisation has survived the wrath and whip of invasion and chains of colonisation ? Yet, the grave mistake would be to assume it can withstand future threats on its own—especially as it has already been extinguished in Afghanistan, nearly erased in Pakistan, and now faces an existential crisis in Bangladesh. 
            The question is not merely if it will survive, but where it will still be standing. India demands a closer, more thoughtful examination. 
            It's resilience is not owed to any single factor but to a powerful convergence of assets within Hinduism—what we recognize as its rich and enduring "culture." 
            This cultural foundation has been the driving force behind India’s endurance through the ages. Edward Burnett Tylor defined culture as "that complex whole which includes knowledge, beliefs, arts, morals, law, customs, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by a human as a member of society".<sup>3</sup> 
            Together,they have shaped the unique culture synonymous with India, creating the wonder that is India..</p>

        <h2></h2>
        <p> A subcontinent with a 5,000 year old history; a civilisation united by its diversity, the richness of its culture, the glory of the past, the turbulences and triumphs, the landmarks of each era, the achievements of each age, the legacy of its many rulers-as you walk through history, through India's geography, and her linguistic and artistic contributions, your individual interpretation will be your very own discovery. 
                When all the knowledge, skill, and passion of mankind are poured into an acknowledgement of something greater than themselves, then that acknowledgement is Art. Spiritual in outlook, idealistic in expression and sublime in interpretation. This culture encompasses a vast tapestry: philosophy, science, religion, ethics, spirituality, art, music, dance, education, literature, oral traditions, politics, marriage rituals, economics, and social structure. 
                These vital components are the forces that sustain each part, ultimately ensuring the continuity of the whole.</p>

        <h2>The State of Education in India</h2>
        <p>Has India’s education system become a contradiction in terms, in that it does not educate and is no longer a system—an orderly arrangement of ideas and functions formulated to achieve a desired objective? A spate of scams, of mass-copying, leaked question papers, and faked certificates, poses a threat to the groves of academe which are being turned into a blackboard jungle, producing hordes of purportedly educated unemployed young people, making a cruel mockery of our vaunted ‘demographic dividend’.</p>

        <h2>Tourism and Environmental Challenges</h2>
        <p>Tourism bucks and real estate greed are still seen running rampant. Whether travellers come looking for physical or spiritual adventures, they become part of the same traffic jams and garbage mountains. Tiger reserves to once-pristine beaches, too often the scene is sadly the same. They crowd onto railway tracks to see Dudhsagar Falls, make Darjeeling run short of drinking water, make Ooty feel indistinguishable from Bengaluru. This is a painful irony. The search for an escape from cities turns tourist destinations into an unpleasant reflection of these cities.</p>

        <h2>The Influence of Technology on Human Attention</h2>
        <p>Very swiftly evolving platforms, designed by some of the most well-resourced companies on Earth, built by some of the most talented product designers, using cutting-edge brain science to maximize the time we spend on these platforms.</p>
