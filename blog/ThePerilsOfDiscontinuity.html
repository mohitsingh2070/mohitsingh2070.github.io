    <section>
        <h2>A Subcontinent with a 5,000-Year History</h2>
        <p>A civilisation united by its diversity, the richness of its culture, the glory of the past, the turbulences and triumphs, the landmarks of each era, the achievements of each age, the legacy of its many rulers—as you walk through history, through India’s geography, and her linguistic and artistic contributions, your individual interpretation will be your very own discovery.</p>
        <p>When all the knowledge, skill, and passion of mankind are poured into an acknowledgement of something greater than themselves, then that acknowledgement is Art. Spiritual in outlook, idealistic in expression and sublime in interpretation.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Challenges of Organizational Dynamics</h2>
        <p>People who came together to help an organisation succeed actually end up delighting in each other’s failures and resenting each other’s success. We withhold information and resources from one another, try to control one another, and blame one another. When I am blaming A or B or department X, Y, or Z and suggesting that all our problems could be solved if only they would straighten up, I am doing it because their shortcomings justify my failure to improve.</p>
        <p>It begins as a conflict between two persons and spreads to a war between many; finally, organisations are filled with people whose energies are largely spent on sustaining illusion.</p>

        <h2>The State of Education in India</h2>
        <p>Has India’s education system become a contradiction in terms, in that it does not educate and is no longer a system—an orderly arrangement of ideas and functions formulated to achieve a desired objective? A spate of scams, of mass-copying, leaked question papers, and faked certificates, poses a threat to the groves of academe which are being turned into a blackboard jungle, producing hordes of purportedly educated unemployed young people, making a cruel mockery of our vaunted ‘demographic dividend’.</p>

        <h2>Tourism and Environmental Challenges</h2>
        <p>Tourism bucks and real estate greed are still seen running rampant. Whether travellers come looking for physical or spiritual adventures, they become part of the same traffic jams and garbage mountains. Tiger reserves to once-pristine beaches, too often the scene is sadly the same. They crowd onto railway tracks to see Dudhsagar Falls, make Darjeeling run short of drinking water, make Ooty feel indistinguishable from Bengaluru. This is a painful irony. The search for an escape from cities turns tourist destinations into an unpleasant reflection of these cities.</p>

        <h2>The Influence of Technology on Human Attention</h2>
        <p>Very swiftly evolving platforms, designed by some of the most well-resourced companies on Earth, built by some of the most talented product designers, using cutting-edge brain science to maximize the time we spend on these platforms.</p>
