        <h2>The Times Of Diwail</h2>
        <p>Festivals are like the bookmarks of the life. For me, Diwali meant guests arriving with boxes of sweets and the EAGER anticipation of one bhaiya who would show up carrying mountains of firecrackers, making my father’s modest, pre-liberalised and half-heartedly shopping efforts seem futile in comparison. The sight of that enormous pile would surge joy so intense that it could drown out any lectures given on that day, like sunlight breaking through after a long downpour. I knew, with absolute certainty, that all of it belonged to me, not to my sisters. Dawn was awaited with the same restless excitement as waiting for a message from your crush, every passing minute stretching longer than it should, each moment filled with silent planning and countless rehearsals of how it would all unfold. My sisters would appoint me as the judge to choose the best rangoli, but my so-called expertise was really just a tool to validate their own choices. It occurred to me that the art in India is not just limited to galleries and museums (as in abroad), it’s woven into the very fabric of everyday life. The leftover colors from the previous Holi would get another chance to breathe the fresh air, and when those would ran out, the kitchen would come to the rescue, turning everyday ingredients into shades that filled the gap. It’s never the festival itself that brings us joy, but the comforting certainty of its repetition, the steadfast rituals that, once experienced, feel as if they will never change. The guests, the sweets, the crackers, the rangoli, diyas lighting up every corner of the balcony - standing tall against the wind, and even if one would give up the others will be ready to give the fire to fuel. .</p>
        <p>
        “The only constant in life is change.” I can’t pinpoint the moment when the invisible threads that once tied Diwali together began to fray. LED strings started as mere complements, then quietly replaced the traditional lamps. Plastic rangoli stickers now greeted the guests. Guests themselves were traded for social media likes and updates. Even the neighbor’s fireworks, once a source of delight, had become a source of nuisance. Family itself now seems to lack devotion it once had, the divine has been exchanged for convenience, spectacle, and imaginary views. Forget about Gods, even the guests have retreated from our doorsteps. Quality time is now spent with strangers in public spaces, where the symbols of celebration have taken over the meaning itself. The tradition has turned into imitation, the body is present but the spirit is gone- just as physically showing up to wish someone well has disappeared. Diwali now has brighter lighting but less warmth, more pictures but less presence, louder fireworks but fewer laughs, more decorations yet dimmer connections, larger houses but lesser gatherings, brighter diyas but flikering souls, more messages yet fewer deliveries, leaving one to feel like a visitor in their own home. A peculiar loneliness, a happiness that wears the disguise of sadness.

      <h2>   The Paradox of Our Time  </h2>
         <div style="text-align: center;"> </p> 
<p>
The paradox of our time in history is that <br>
we have taller buildings but shorter tempers; <br>
wider freeways, but narrower viewpoints. <br>
We spend more, but have less; <br>
we buy more but enjoy less.</p>

<p>
We have bigger houses and smaller families, <br>
more conveniences, but less time; <br>
we have more degrees, but less sense; <br>
more knowledge, but less judgement; <br>
more experts, yet more problems, <br>
more medicine, but less wellness. 

<p>
We drink too much, smoke too much, <br>
spend too recklessly, laugh too little,<br> 
drive too fast, get too angry, <br>
stay up too late, get up too tired,<br> 
read too little, watch TV too much, and pray too seldom.</p>

              <p>
We have multiplied our possessions, but reduced our values. <br>
We talk too much, love too seldom, and hate too often. <br>
We've learned how to make a living, but not a life, <br>
we've added years to life not life to years.  </p>

              <p>
We've been all the way to the moon and back, but have <br>
trouble crossing the street to meet a new neighbor. <br>
We conquered outer space but not inner space. <br>
We've done larger things, but not better things.</p>

              <p>
We've cleaned up the air, but polluted the soul. <br>
We've conquered the atom, but not our prejudice. <br>
We write more, but learn less. <br>
We plan more, but accomplish less. <br>
We've learned to rush, but not to wait. <br>
  
We build more computers to hold more information to 
produce more copies than ever, but we communicate 
less and less.  </p>

        <p>
These are the times of fast foods and slow digestion; <br>
big men and small character; <br>
steep profits and shallow relationships. <br> 
  
These are the days of two incomes but more divorce, <br>
fancier houses but broken homes. <br>
        </p>
      <p>
These are days of quick trips, disposable diapers, <br>
throw-away morality, one-night stands, <br>
overweight bodies, and pills that do everything 
from cheer to quiet, to kill. <br>
  
It is a time when there is much in the show window and
nothing in the stockroom. <br>
A time when technology  can bring this letter to you,  <br>
          and a time when you can choose 
either to  share this insight, <br>
          or to just hit delete.</p>

                <p>
Remember, spend some time with your loved ones,  <br>
because they are not going to be around forever. <br>
  
Remember, say a kind word to someone who looks up 
to you in awe,  <br>
                    because that little person soon 
will grow up and leave your side. <br>
                </p>
  <p>
Remember, to give a warm hug to the one next to you,  <br>
because that is the only treasure you can give with 
your heart and it doesn't cost a cent. <br>
  
Remember, to say "I love you" to your partner and 
your loved ones,  <br>
      but most of all mean it.  <br>
A kiss and an embrace will mend hurt when it comes 
from deep inside of you. <br>

          
Give time to Love, give time to speak, give time to 
share the precious thoughts in your mind. </p>

<!--  <h2>Conclusion</h2>  -->       
        <p>I often wondered why guests came with sweets, I never knew whether they came to share or simply to get rid of them. We’d pass the same sweets from house to house, a game of musical chairs where the treats kept moving, only to finally land with someone. Now the doorbells would seldom ring. We have started celebrating our festivals digitally.
</p>
        <p>

The light may be dimmed, but it is not yet extinguished, there is still hope to carry that flickering memorial flame and remind the neighbors of what has been lost. Yet, I fear it might awaken memories not of sweetness, but of wounds, a sense of loss that cannot be explained to those who have never known it in the first place. The rangoli itself revealed that even in the midst of chaos, dust could be coaxed into order, a fragile pattern of control and beauty that hints at the possibility of meaning amidst disorder.</p>
