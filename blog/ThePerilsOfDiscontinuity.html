        <h2>Inculturation and indigestion</h2>
        <p></p>Inculturation and indigestion is not an unknown achilles heel for hindus. 
            Inculturation stands for ones attempt to synthesise the culture and belief of another religion (Hinduism) not with a view to assimilate with it but to subvert it from within, with the eventual aim of conversion.<sup>1</sup>
            If the powerful aarti at Vishwanath temple is in danger of dying out, it is not so much because the temple is controlled by “secular bureaucrats”, “corrupt bureaucrats”, “indifferent bureaucrats” or even simply bureaucrats would suffice.<sup>2</sup>
            How come the oldest surviving civilisation has survived the wrath and whip of invasion and chains of colonisation ? Yet, the grave mistake would be to assume it can withstand future threats on its own—especially as it has already been extinguished in Afghanistan, nearly erased in Pakistan, and now faces an existential crisis in Bangladesh. 
            The question is not merely if it will survive, but where it will still be standing. India demands a closer, more thoughtful examination. 
            It's resilience is not owed to any single factor but to a powerful convergence of assets within Hinduism—what we recognize as its rich and enduring "culture." 
            This cultural foundation has been the driving force behind India’s endurance through the ages. Edward Burnett Tylor defined culture as "that complex whole which includes knowledge, beliefs, arts, morals, law, customs, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by a human as a member of society".<sup>3</sup> 
            Together,they have shaped the unique culture synonymous with India, creating the wonder that is India.</p>

        <h2>India's Living Heritage</h2>
        <p> A subcontinent with a 5,000 year old history; a civilisation united by its diversity, the richness of its culture, the glory of the past, the turbulences and triumphs, the landmarks of each era, the achievements of each age, the legacy of its many rulers-as you walk through history, through India's geography, and her linguistic and artistic contributions, your individual interpretation will be your very own discovery. 
                When all the knowledge, skill, and passion of mankind are poured into an acknowledgement of something greater than themselves, then that acknowledgement is Art. Spiritual in outlook, idealistic in expression and sublime in interpretation. This culture encompasses a vast tapestry: philosophy, science, religion, ethics, spirituality, art, music, dance, education, literature, oral traditions, politics, marriage rituals, economics, and social structure. 
                These vital components are the forces that sustain each part, ultimately ensuring the continuity of the whole.</p>

        <p>The specific elements of culture are nurtured, preserved, and passed down to future generations. This process can be likened to the cultivation of curd, where the existing curd (or jaman) acts as the starter to cultivate fresh curd. In the same way, culture thrives through traditions, beliefs, and values that must be internalized. 
                The "starters" in culture are the traditions, stories, rituals, and practices. By engaging in rituals, listening to stories, and observing customs, each generation releases these cultural "starters," enriching the soil of society and making it fertile for embodying cultural values. These values evolve through interpretation and personal experiences, subtly changing while retaining their core essence. 
                Just as trees in a vast forest shed their dry leaves, enriching the soil below, cultural values are passed on, enriching the hearts and minds of individuals, making them fertile with a vibrant, living connection to their heritage. 
                Curd culture is resilient, adapting to its environment and developing unique flavors depending on the milk and local conditions. Similarly, cultural values evolve to meet the demands of changing times and contexts, while preserving their core essence to remain relevant and meaningful across diverse regions and social settings.</p>

        <h2>Unimaginable becomes inevitable</h2>
        <p>The food my grandmother once prepared at home—various pickles, sweets, seasonal delicacies, and stories that nourished the mind—are now absent from my own home. My mother's signature dishes are now outsourced from the markets in this generation. The stories we once shared are now crafted by corporations, shaping our thoughts and experiences.
        The rituals of rangolis are now commodified by industries, sold as plastic replicas, while plastic flowers have replaced the natural ones adorning the idols. 
        The songs and mantras once chanted are now being replaced by Alexa, Siri, and Bixby, the voices of our times. The customs has turned into a commercial commodity, where its value is measured by the weight in one's pockets. 
        The sanctity of places of worship has been lost, transforming them into place of “Pradarshan” rather than spaces for “Darshan” and connection. Ethics is now being taught to a civilization that once prided itself on the principle of "Pran Jaye par Vachan na Jaye" (Life may depart, but one's word must never be broken). 
        We have begun copying Western music and dance, losing our connection to Carnatic and Hindustani traditions. Now, we cater to what sells in the market, having abandoned our own playground, and are attempting to play someone else's game on their courts.
        In a country that once took pride in its knowledge systems and cherished science, it is the loss of this legacy that has left our minds unscientific. Has India's education system become a contradiction in terms, in that it does not educate and is no longer a system. 
        A spate of scams, of mass-copying, leaked question papers, and faked certificates, poses a threat to the groves of academe which are being turned into a blackboard jungle, producing hordes of purportedly educated unemployed young people, making a cruel mockery of our vaunted 'demographic dividend'. 
        This impoverishment is felt not only in our education but also in the realm of occupation, where we are burdened with frustration. In an organisation, this has become the norm “People who came together to help an organisation succeed actually end up delighting in each other's failures and resenting each other's success. 
        We withhold information and resources from one another, try to control one another, and blame one another. When I am blaming A or B or department X,Y or Z and suggesting that all our problems to be solved in only they straighten up, I am doing it because their shortcomings justify my failure to improve. It begins as a conflict between two persons and spreads to a war between many, finally organisations are filled with people whose energies are largely spent on sustaining illusion.“<sup>4</sup> 
        Our institutions are no longer sacred; instead, they have become places where personal agendas take precedence, and the original purpose for which they were created has been lost. Pilgrimage has transformed into tourism, and real estate greed continues to run rampant. Whether travelers seek physical or spiritual adventures, they find themselves caught in the same traffic jams and surrounded by piles of garbage. From tiger reserves to once-pristine beaches, the scene is often all too familiar. 
        Tourists crowd onto railway tracks to see Dudhsagar Falls, drain Darjeeling’s water supply, and make Ooty feel no different from Bengaluru. It’s a painful irony—the search for an escape from the cities only turns these destinations into an unpleasant mirror of the very urban life they sought to leave behind.
        Our personal lives (there is nothing personal or professional in life because there is no true separation between personal and professional, just one unified life) are also not spared by the rapidly evolving platforms created by some of the world’s most well-resourced companies, designed by brilliant product designers, and fueled by cutting-edge brain science to maximize the time we spend on them.
        <div style="text-align: center;"> <p>Nothing would confess its own pretence</p> <p>Even to itself in the ambiguous heart:</p> <p>A vast deception was the law of things;</p> <p>It was a world of sorrow and of hate,</p> <p>Sorrow with hatred for its lonely joy,</p> <p>Hatred with others’ sorrow as its feast;<sup>5</sup></p> </div>

        </p>
        <p>
        Characterized by an insatiable greed for material possessions and a "neighbour's envy, owner's pride" philosophy. The enjoyment of pleasures, even the occasional splurge or extravagance, is an absolutely essential part of life after all, Kama is one of the three priorities in life. 
        But, apart from the fact that, beyond a point, the law of diminishing returns applies even to the enjoyment of pleasures, the fact today is that the very definition of "pleasures", and the things which are supposed to provide those pleasures, is dictated by the media and the capitalist forces controlling the media. The use-and-throw culture of western consumerism, with all the accompanying wholesale depletion of natural resources, wastage and extravagance, and pollution of every aspect of the environment, is becoming prevalent everywhere. 
        Life, for the average Indian, has become a feverish, competitive, acquisitive, exhibitionistic and expensive activity, and Indian society is beginning to feel all the lethal ill-effects social, economic and psychological of consumerist life, too many and too complicated to be detailed here.
        </p>

        
        The reflection of society is gauged by the status of women. Instead of addressing the root causes of violence, we focus on isolated incidents when framing our criminal justice policies. 
        This approach leads us to perceive such incidents as exceptional, committed by individuals who are somehow different from the rest of 'us,' yet resemble us in every other way. Preventing sexual violence requires us to examine the deeper reasons and conditions that make women feel unsafe in every aspect of their lives. 
        If we fail to do so, we will continue to confuse systemic violence with isolated aberrations. 
        Let India never forget the vow of Krishna to Draupadi when she narrated her humiliation at the hands of the Kauravas to him. 
        <div style="text-align: center;"> <p>The heavens may tumble; </p><p>the mountains may be razed; </p><p>the oceans may dry like a corpse’s bones;</p><p> Earth herself may rupture, but I shall keep my oath to you. </p><p>To avenge the crime against you, </p><p>there will be a war to end all wars.</p> </div>

        Marriage rituals have increasingly become a burden rather than a celebration. Destination weddings are now offered as a convenient option to shorten engagements, while the deep value of traditional rituals—the very building blocks of the marriage—are discarded in the pursuit of the destination. 
        In the process, culture is sacrificed in favor of trendy locations and convenience.
        The tragedy is not just that the unimaginable is becoming inevitable, but that even the imaginable is now becoming unavoidable. We must be ready to face any eventuality, rather than trying to prepare for every possible contingency.
